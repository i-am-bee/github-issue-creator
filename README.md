> This project is in early beta stage. Expect bugs and breaking changes.

A multi-agent system for creating well-structured GitHub issues using the [BeeAI Framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework). This system coordinates between specialized agents to draft issues, check for duplicates, and create final GitHub issues with customizable templates. The system is consumable via the [Agent Stack](https://github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack) (UI and CLI) through the A2A protocol.

✅ Multi-agent workflow
🔄 Real-time trajectory tracking
📝 Customizable issue templates

## Motivation

As AI coding assistants become more capable, **the bottleneck in software development is shifting from implementation to specification**. When AI can handle the *how*, the quality of your *what* and *why* becomes critical.

This project ensures every GitHub issue is well-scoped, consistently formatted, and grounded in your project's context—making it ready for both human developers and AI assistants to act on efficiently.

## Features

- 📝 **Template Support**: Bug report and feature request templates
- 📖 **Documentation Grounding**: Technical Writer uses project documentation for technical accuracy
- 🔄 **Self-Reflection**: Writer validates drafts against format rules and requirements automatically
- 🔗 **GitHub Integration**: Seamless interaction through GitHub MCP server
- 🏷️ **Issue Types Support**: Automatic detection and use of organization issue types with fallback to default types (Feature/Bug)
- 🏷️ **Labels Support**: Automatic retrieval and application of repository labels to created issues
- 📊 **Trajectory Tracking**: Real-time visibility into agent interactions and tool usage
- 🔍 **Duplicate Prevention**: Intelligent search for existing similar issues
- ✅ **User Approval**: Human-in-the-loop workflow with approval gates
- ⚙️ **Conditional Requirements**: Enforced workflow steps and dependencies
- 🔒 **Repository-Scoped Tools**: Pre-configured GitHub tools with repository context for better security

## What is GitHub Issue Creator?

The GitHub Issue Creator orchestrates a multi-step workflow using specialized agents:

- **Project Manager**: Coordinates the entire workflow and manages agent handoffs
- **Technical Writer**: Creates structured issue drafts from user input using templates, grounded with project documentation for technical accuracy. Includes self-reflection loop to ensure strict format and rule compliance.
- **Analyst**: Searches for existing similar issues to prevent duplicates

This gives you consistent, professional GitHub issues while preventing duplicates and maintaining quality standards. The system integrates with GitHub through the [GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github) for seamless repository interactions.

## Use Cases

Perfect for:
- Automated issue creation from user reports
- Maintaining consistent issue formatting across repositories
- Preventing duplicate issues through intelligent search
- Multi-step workflows with user approval gates

## Agents Included

🎯 **[Project Manager](src/github_issue_creator/agents/manager.py)** - Manages the complete issue lifecycle from draft to creation
📝 **[Technical Writer](src/github_issue_creator/agents/writer.py)** - Creates structured issues using customizable templates with self-reflection for quality assurance
🔍 **[Analyst](src/github_issue_creator/agents/analyst.py)** - Searches for similar existing issues

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --group dev

# Copy and edit environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Set your MODEL, API_KEY, GITHUB_PAT, and templates in .env

# Start the agent server
uv run server
```

The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and register the GitHub Issue Creator agent that coordinates the complete workflow.

## Security Considerations

> [!WARNING]
> **Important Security Notes:**
> 
> - **GitHub Token Scoping**: It is **critical** to scope your GitHub Personal Access Token (GITHUB_PAT) to only the specific repositories you intend to use with this system. Do not use tokens with broad repository access.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configure the system using environment variables:

```bash
# Model Configuration
MODEL=openai:gpt-5-nano
API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# GitHub Configuration  
GITHUB_PAT=your_github_personal_access_token
GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repository-name

# Documentation for issue grounding (optional)
DOCS_URL=https://example.com/llms-full.txt

# Issue Templates (URLs preferred)
TEMPLATE_BUG_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md"
TEMPLATE_FEATURE_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md"

# Alternative: Direct template content
TEMPLATE_BUG="your bug report template..."
TEMPLATE_FEATURE="your feature request template..."
```

1. **User Input**: Describe the bug or feature request
2. **Draft Creation**: Technical Writer creates structured draft using templates
3. **Self-Reflection**: Writer automatically validates and corrects draft format and rule compliance
4. **User Review**: User reviews and approves the final draft
5. **Duplicate Check**: Analyst searches for similar existing issues
6. **Issue Creation**: Final GitHub issue is created with proper formatting

## Development

```bash
# Install development dependencies
uv sync --group dev

# Run linting
uv run ruff check

# Run formatting
uv run ruff format
```

## Architecture

The system uses the BeeAI Framework's Requirement Agent with:
- **Conditional Requirements**: Enforced workflow sequence
- **Handoff Tools**: Agent-to-agent delegation with artifact support
- **Permission Requirements**: User approval gates
- **Trajectory Middleware**: Real-time progress tracking
- **[Artifact System](./docs/ARTIFACT_SYSTEM.md)**: Out-of-band storage for large content (issue drafts, schemas) to avoid context pollution

## Roadmap

### WIP

- [ ] 🚧 **Improve multi-turn conversations** - Better context handling across multiple interactions
- [ ] 🚧 **GitHub Issue Types field** - Automatic detection and use of organization issue types with fallback
- [ ] 🚧 **Pass artifacts by reference** - Reference artifacts in conversation history instead of including full content
- [ ] 🚧 **Self-reflection loop** - Writer validates drafts against format rules and requirements, automatically correcting issues before user review

### Next

- [ ] **Support OAuth auth flow** - Enable OAuth authentication for GitHub integration
- [ ] **Treat issues as artifacts** - Return issue drafts as artifacts in A2A protocol instead of messages
- [ ] **Improve agent configuration** - Configure GitHub repository from Agent Stack UI
- [ ] **Build as Docker image** - Containerized deployment for easier hosting
- [ ] **Support attachements** - Allow users to upload files (screenshots, videos)

### Done

- [x] **GitHub Labels field** - Allow the agent to correctly populate the labels ([#312](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/issues/312))
- [x] **MCP direct repository configuration** - Pre-configure the MCP tool with repository settings instead of relying on LLM to pass repository name
- [x] **Improve trajectory metadata** - Enhanced progress tracking and debugging capabilities
- [x] **Elicitation support** - Interactive tool use approval and clarification workflows

### Nice to have

- [ ] **Add streaming support** - Real-time response streaming for better UX
- [ ] **Add RAG instead of grounding** - Dynamic document retrieval for better context
- [ ] **Add evaluation datasets** - Comprehensive testing with real-world issue examples
